-- Execute this directly in Supabase SQL editor

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Restaurant owners can view their reservations" ON reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Restaurant owners can insert reservations" ON reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Restaurant owners can update their reservations" ON reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Restaurant owners can delete their reservations" ON reservations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Unauthenticated users can create reservations" ON reservations;

-- Create a simple policy that allows all operations for now
-- This will allow both authenticated and unauthenticated users to work
CREATE POLICY "Allow all reservations operations" ON reservations
