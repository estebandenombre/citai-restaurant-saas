# Trial System Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for the simplified trial system without Stripe integration.

## üöÄ Overview

The trial system provides:
- **Automatic 14-day free trial** for all new users
- **Manual plan management** through database updates
- **Trial expiration handling** with user notifications
- **Contact-based upgrades** instead of automatic payments

## üìã System Architecture

### Database Schema

The system uses the following columns in the `users` table:

- **`plan_id`**: References the subscription plan from `subscription_plans` table
- **`plan_status`**: Current status ('trial', 'active', 'canceled', 'trial_expired')
- **`trial_start`**: When the trial period began
- **`trial_end`**: When the trial period ends
- **`current_period_start`**: Start of current billing period
- **`current_period_end`**: End of current billing period

### Subscription Plans

Available plans in the `subscription_plans` table:

1. **Free Trial Plan** (`free-trial-plan`)
   - 14-day free trial
   - All features except AI Chat
   - Automatic assignment to new users

2. **Starter Plan** (`starter-plan`)
   - $29/month
   - Same features as Free Trial
   - Manual upgrade required

3. **Pro Plan** (`pro-plan`)
   - $79/month
   - Includes AI Chat Assistant
   - Manual upgrade required

4. **Multi Plan** (`multi-plan`)
   - $199/month
   - Multiple restaurants
   - Manual upgrade required

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the cleanup script to remove Stripe and set up the trial system:

```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
scripts/102-remove-stripe-cleanup.sql
```

### 2. Verify Setup

Run the verification script to ensure everything is working:

```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
scripts/103-verify-trial-system.sql
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file (remove Stripe variables):

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## üîÑ User Flow

### New User Registration

1. User creates account
2. Trigger automatically assigns 14-day trial
3. User gets access to all features except AI Chat
4. Trial period starts immediately

### During Trial

1. User can use all features except AI Chat
2. Dashboard shows trial status and days remaining
3. User can request upgrade through contact form

### Trial Expiration

1. After 14 days, trial expires
2. User sees trial expiration banner
3. User must contact support to upgrade
4. No automatic plan change

### Plan Upgrade

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Plan Management

### Upgrade User to Paid Plan

```sql
-- Upgrade to Pro Plan
UPDATE users 
SET 
    plan_id = (SELECT id FROM subscription_plans WHERE name = 'pro-plan'),
    plan_status = 'active',
    current_period_start = NOW(),
    current_period_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 month'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Extend Trial Period

```sql
-- Extend trial by 7 days
UPDATE users 
SET trial_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Cancel Subscription

```sql
-- Cancel user subscription
UPDATE users 
SET plan_status = 'canceled'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Downgrade Plan

```sql
-- Downgrade to Starter Plan
UPDATE users 
SET 
    plan_id = (SELECT id FROM subscription_plans WHERE name = 'starter-plan'),
    plan_status = 'active',
    current_period_start = NOW(),
    current_period_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 month'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Check User Status

```sql
-- View all users and their trial status
SELECT 
    u.email,
    u.plan_status,
    u.trial_start,
    u.trial_end,
    sp.display_name as plan_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN u.trial_end < NOW() AND u.plan_status = 'trial' THEN 'TRIAL_EXPIRED'
        WHEN u.trial_end >= NOW() AND u.plan_status = 'trial' THEN 'TRIAL_ACTIVE'
        WHEN u.plan_status = 'active' THEN 'PAID_PLAN'
        ELSE 'UNKNOWN'
    END as current_status
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN subscription_plans sp ON u.plan_id = sp.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;
```

### Trial Statistics

```sql
-- Get trial statistics
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN plan_status = 'trial' THEN 1 END) as trial_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN plan_status = 'trial' AND trial_end < NOW() THEN 1 END) as expired_trials,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN plan_status = 'trial' AND trial_end >= NOW() THEN 1 END) as active_trials,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN plan_status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as paid_users
FROM users;
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test New User Registration

1. Create a new user account
2. Verify automatic trial assignment
3. Check trial_end is 14 days from creation
4. Verify trial status in dashboard

### Test Trial Expiration

1. Manually set trial_end to past date:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET trial_end = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

2. Refresh dashboard
3. Verify trial expiration banner appears
4. Check that AI Chat is disabled

### Test Plan Upgrade

1. Use contact form on pricing page
2. Send upgrade request
3. Manually update user plan in database
4. Verify plan change in dashboard

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### User Not Getting Trial

```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'trigger_assign_trial';

-- Manually assign trial
UPDATE users 
SET 
    plan_id = (SELECT id FROM subscription_plans WHERE name = 'free-trial-plan'),
    plan_status = 'trial',
    trial_start = NOW(),
    trial_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com' AND plan_id IS NULL;
```

#### Trial Not Expiring

```sql
-- Check trial expiration function
SELECT is_user_trial_expired(user_id) FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Manually expire trial
UPDATE users 
SET trial_end = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

#### Plan Status Issues

```sql
-- Reset user plan status
UPDATE users 
SET 
    plan_status = 'trial',
    trial_start = NOW(),
    trial_end = NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```
